Fitness Metrics Package

This package provides functions to calculate fitness metrics such as step count, distance traveled, and calories burned based on input data.
Installation

You can install this package using the devtools package:


devtools::install_github("Yo-Yo-init/fittracker")

Usage

To use this package, first load it using the library() function:

library(fittracker)

Then, you can use the get_fitness_metrics() function to calculate fitness metrics for your data:

# Load sample fitness data
data <- read.csv("fitness_data.csv")

# Calculate fitness metrics
metrics <- get_fitness_metrics(data)

The get_fitness_metrics() function requires a data frame with columns for steps, distance, gender, age, weight, and height. If any of these columns are missing, the function will return an error. The calories_burned() function, which is called by get_fitness_metrics(), requires values for gender, age, weight, and height to be present and non-missing in the input data.
